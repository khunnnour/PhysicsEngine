# Physics Engine

As a part of a class, I had to make a rudimentary physics engine to replace the the Unity one (it isn't particularly good). It uses a C++ DLL for the actual calculations (part of the requirements).

Then, for my Computer Architecture a few semesters later, I tried to speed up the underlying library using inline Assembly and compiler intrinsics. It didn't work, but if you want to skim the project write up, it is included in the repo under the "WriteUp" folder.
